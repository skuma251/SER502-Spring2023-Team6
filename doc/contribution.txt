Name: Amarjeet Singh

Tasks Completed: 
- Discussed and Implemented grammar related to strings, arithmetic expression and removed left recursion from the different rules
-Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR
- Implement the tokenizer using Python and generating the .token file and ensuring that the grammar accurately defines the language
- Passing the tokens file to parser and also working on some documentation
-Collaborate with the other team members to ensure quality and consistency across the project

Name: Siri Rachappa Jarmale

Tasks Completed: 
- I researched and delved into the implementation process of compilers, and developed a design based on my findings.
-Coded out grammar related to the print statement 
- Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR.
- The intermediate code generated was verified by comparing it with the parse tree.
-Work on the language design and grammar using regular and context-free language specifiers
-Develop the lexical analyzer and ensure its consistency with the parser
-Document the language/grammar/compiler/intermediate form/runtime in the PowerPoint presentation


Name: Subham Kumar 

Tasks Completed: 
 -Discussed and implemented grammar
- Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR.
- Implemented the grammar for constructing the advance for loop.
- Worked on the design of various control statements of the program
- Worked on documentation and creation of the final pdf.

Task Completion Plan:
- Implement the intermediate form of the language, such as the abstract syntax tree, three-address code, or byte code
- Generating the parse tree using python ANTLR library.
- Implement the functionalities of the control statement of the programming language.
- Can work on different data structures required for the language.
- Ensure that the parser and runtime environment agree on the intermediate form
Contribute to the PowerPoint presentation and video demonstration of the language
