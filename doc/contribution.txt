Name: Amarjeet Singh

Tasks Completed: 
- Discussed and Implemented grammar related to strings, arithmetic expression and removed left recursion from the different rules
-Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR
- Implemented the tokenizer using Python and generated the .token file and ensuring that the grammar accurately defines the language
- Passed the tokens file to parser and also working on some documentation
-Collaborated with the other team members to ensure quality and consistency across the project
- Worked on evaluator file for the forrange,while loop and ternary operator conditions.
