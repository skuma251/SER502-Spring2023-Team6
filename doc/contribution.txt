Name: Amarjeet Singh

Tasks Completed: 
- Discussed and Implemented grammar related to strings, arithmetic expression and removed left recursion from the different rules
-Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR

Task Completion Plan: 
- Implement the parsing process and ensure that the grammar accurately defines the language
-Work on the language runtime environment and implement fundamental operations needed for a simple programming language
-Collaborate with the other team members to ensure quality and consistency across the project


Name: Paromita Roy

Name: Siri Rachappa Jarmale

Tasks Completed: 
- I researched and delved into the implementation process of compilers, and developed a design based on my findings.
-Coded out grammar related to the print statement 
- Modifications were made to the grammar structure to ensure its compatibility with ANTLR.
- The intermediate code generated was verified by comparing it with the parse tree.

Task Completion Plan:
-Work on the language design and grammar using regular and context-free language specifiers
-Develop the lexical analyzer and ensure its consistency with the parser
-Document the language/grammar/compiler/intermediate form/runtime in the PowerPoint presentation


Name: Subham Kumar 

Tasks Completed:
